# isogram_printer
An Javascript project to render 3D function isograms in SVG with HTML UI

## What is an Isogram?
An isogram is a plot of a multivariate function in which one or more variables are held constant. One can think of this as a plot of a "slice" of that function.  
In this project functions of the form $z=f(x,y)$ will be plotted with values of y held fixed.  
This is similar to the concept of a contour line, except contour lines generally refer to drawing $z=f(x,y)$ for fixed $z$.

## What do we get out of this project?
By ploting multiple isograms over a range of different y values we obtain a "exploration" of the function that can be assembled into a pleasing 3D visualization of the plot.
